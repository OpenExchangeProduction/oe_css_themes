    <p>CARE believes that everyone has a right to basic education. But in many parts of the world children, particularly girls, are denied this right. In Niger, for example, only one in two girls attends primary school, just one in 10 goes to middle school and only one in 50 goes to high school.</p>
    <p>CARE works with individuals, communities, partner organisations and governments to address all aspects of basic education. We train teachers to improve the quality of education, link education and health programmes and work with regional and national governments to develop and deliver innovative education programmes. Investing in girls’ education creates a ripple effect: educated girls tend to delay their first pregnancies, have healthier children, earn more income for the family, and are far more likely to send their own children to school. The result: wealthier families and communities. So, the empowerment of girls is truly empowering, not just for them, but for everyone.</p>

    <p>The impacts of climate change are being felt most profoundly in those parts of the world that have contributed least to causing the problem. The consequences are particularly serious in developing countries where livelihoods and ecosystems are highly sensitive to changes in climate; the majority of people rely on the natural resource base for their livelihoods; and the capacity to adapt is limited by poverty, poor governance and inequitable distribution of resources and power.</p>
    <p>That’s why we’re working globally to ensure that the rights of the poorest and most vulnerable people are heard at the international climate change negotiations. That’s why we’re advocating for resources and action to be targeted towards helping people to adapt to the changes that are already occurring. And that’s why we’re advocating for governments to put poor people’s concerns at the top of the agenda when planning national responses to climate change.</p>

    <p>As many as 2.8 billion people – nearly half the world’s population – survive on less than $2 a day. And 1.2 billion of them, the majority women and girls, live on less than $1.25 – that’s about €1 – a day. The majority of them are women and girls. Due to COVID-19, recent progress that has been made to address poverty has been set back; women’s livelihoods have been especially impacted as they are 1.8 times more likely to have lost their jobs during the crisis.</p>
    <p>Even before the pandemic, CARE was helping women to build better livelihoods, earn more income and create businesses that provide jobs, support families and boost local economies. For example, CARE’s Village Savings and Loan Association model helps millions of women, and their communities, to begin to invest in business ventures – such as expanding their farm to begin selling at local markets, or opening a village shop. We back this up with business training so that women have the skills to budget for and manage a small business.</p>
